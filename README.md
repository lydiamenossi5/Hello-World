#My First Repository
This is my first repository created for **BAIS:3050 – BAIS Professional Preparation**.  
It serves as practice for using GitHub, writing clean documentation with Markdown, and building confidence in version control.  
This project reflects my background in **Business Analytics & Information Systems** and my interest in combining data, technology, and problem-solving.
